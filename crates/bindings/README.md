# Anoma EVM Protocol Adapter Bindings

This package provides [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) bindings for the conversion of Rust and [RISC Zero](https://risczero.com/) types into [EVM types](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/types.html) and exposes the deployment addresses on the different supported networks using the [alloy-rs](https://github.com/alloy-rs)
library.

## Prerequisites

   ```sh
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```

2. Install [RISC Zero `rzup`](https://github.com/risc0/risc0) with

   ```sh
   curl -L https://risczero.com/install | sh
   ```

3. Install the RISC Zero version 3.0.3 with

   ```sh
   rzup install cargo-risczero 3.0.3
   ```
